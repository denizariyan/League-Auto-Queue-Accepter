# Automatic League Queue Accepter

A Python script utilizing OpenCV with template matching to accept a league game while AFK. In other words, just clicks to accept button when it pops up so you dont have to sit in front of the computer.

## Usage

After queuing up for a game, launch the script. The console window will pop up while the script is waiting for the matchmaking, when the ready check pops up the script will automatically click the ready button and exit the script.  

## Running with a language other than Turkish

If you have league running on a language other than Turkish just take a screenshot of the accept text as I did and replace it with the [template](template.png) file.
