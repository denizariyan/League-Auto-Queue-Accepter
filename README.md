## League Game Auto Accepter

Used to accept league games when you are AFK, has one purpose and nothing else I made it for myself to accept TFT games while lying on the bed and I probably wont update/upgrade this ever. The code is really, really messy. I wrote this in 5 minutes while waiting on a game update you probably shouldn't take anything as an example from this project.

If you are planning to use your computer while this script is running in the background you should add a sleep function so that it doesn't hog all the CPU resources.

## Running with a language other than Turkish
If you have league running on a language other than Turkish just take a screenshot of the accept text as I did and replace it with the [template](template.png) file.

I wont provide instructions on how to setup or use. This source code is shared as is and I dont take any responsibility if anything happens to your league account.
